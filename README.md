# Major's Resume

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### I don't know how to use Git or GitHub, but I want to look at your resume.
It might be easiest to visit the HTML version directly: http://majorhayden.com/

#### I want to make a pull request.
I wouldn't have put this here unless someone had asked about it before.

Feel free to open up issues and/or pull requests on this repository if you spot something incorrect.

#### Your resume looks funny.
It's actually in the form of a [man page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).

#### I know what man pages are. Why did you design your resume to look like a man page?
First off, I thought it was somewhat comical.  You can work within the [section definitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections) relatively easily so that the right details are under the correct sections.  However, some sections didn't match up and I had to create my own.

I also wanted my resume to stand out in the crowd.  It's completely plain text and you can view it on almost any platform that you can find.  There's no need to open extra applications to read it and you can pretty much copy and paste it anywhere.  Try to do that with the average resume made in Microsoft Word. ;)

#### Why don't you do it completely in groff and just convert to HTML?
Have you ever tried to write anything in [groff format](http://linux.die.net/man/7/groff)?  It's arduous.  I'm working on adapting some scripts to convert the HTML (or possibly markdown) to groff (for future RPM/DEB packages) but I'm not quite finished yet.

#### Where did you get the idea?
A [fellow Racker's](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/man-chung/30/180/b7b) first name is Man and some of us chipped in and put together a man page for him a few years ago.  It contained a giant ascii art image of Man as well as a short bio.  Long story short, it was packaged up into RPM's and spread around the company.

I remembered these shenanigans when I was looking to rework my resume last year and I decided to apply some of the same ideas (without the giant ascii art, of course) to my own resume.

#### Where can I go to be entertained by your peculiar sense of humor?
[Look no further](http://thesocialnerd.com). (Please don't take anything there seriously, though.) ;)

#### I have more questions for you.
